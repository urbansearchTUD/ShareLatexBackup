\section{Search Engine}

For the end user to be able to query the processed data we need to build a search engine. This search engine can be powered by Neo4j in the back since we are using this to store our structured data.
Querying the Neo4j database can be done using their REST API or can be done using drivers for the programming language of our application (Python).
