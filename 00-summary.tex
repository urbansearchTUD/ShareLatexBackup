\chapter*{Summary}

This project was intended to design and implement a system that is able to quantify and visualise intercity relations, using open data. 

According to their web site1 , ”OTB seeks to make a visible contribution to society by addressing societal challenges in the field of the built environment”. However, with the growing amount of information available, they have the need for IT solutions to support their research. This project was intended to design and implement a system that is able to quantify and visualise intercity relations, using the information from open data. Since there is a lot of data freely available, the challenge was to accurately delimit the boundaries of the project and then convert the information from within these boundaries to something the researchers could work with. Moreover, the students had to focus on both a full-fledged back-end and front-end. The client was happy to see that the students were able to deliver a viable product. However, some work has to be done before the product can fully satisfy the client’s needs. For this, recommendations have been made, in order to provide future developers with pointers to continue on the application.






Although we did manage to satisfy most of the requirements that were .. together with our client at the beginning of the project, we do feel their is room for improvements. These
