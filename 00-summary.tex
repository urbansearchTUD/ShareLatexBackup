\todo{Instead of abstract, add a single page summary}
It is hard if not impossible to measure the strength of relationships between cities using existing technologies. Because of this, it remains uncertain how exactly economic growth is affected by urbanisation. The universally accepted explanation is that only increasing size of cities affects economic growth \cite{porter2000location}. In this report, we develop a methodology that allows for determining intercity relationship strengths, using open data.



Although we did manage to satisfy most of the requirements that were .. together with our client at the beginning of the project, we do feel their is room for improvements. 













For this, we evaluate whether graph databases like Neo4j \cite{neo4j} or document search engines such as ElasticSearch \cite{elasticsearch} are best suited and describe machine learning algorithms for categorising data based on the co-occurrence of city names. Additionally, we present visualisation techniques to be able to intuitively analyse the results.
