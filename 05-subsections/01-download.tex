This required functions that would parse the Common Crawl indices and gather the data that corresponds to these indices. The first step in parsing the Common Crawl indices and filtering out the indices that have a HTTP Status Code\footnote{\url{https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html}} other than 200, as only these indices with these HTTP Status Code would be useful.
