\section{Front-End}
An important part of the UrbanSearch system is the part where the extracted and processed data get visualised and made accessible for the end-user. Our goals were to provide the end-users with a clear and easy to use interface. This means the extracted relations should be visualised in such a way so that the user can make sense of the information easily. Another desire that was expressed by our client, was the possibility to manipulate the displayed information easy, fast and in a intuitive way. How we reached these goals is described below.

\subsection{Technical Overview}
