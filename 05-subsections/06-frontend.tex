\section{Front-End}
An important part of the UrbanSearch system is the part where the extracted and processed data are visualised and made accessible for the end user. Our goals were to provide the end users with a clear and easy to use interface. Extracted relations should therefore be visualised in such a way that the user can make sense of the information easily. Another desire that was expressed by our client, was the possibility to manipulate the displayed information, in a fast, easy and intuitive way. How we tried to reach these goals is described below.

\subsection{Technical Overview}
In this section we will discuss some of the main technical aspects of the UrbanSearch project. \maybe{We will give a high level overview of and a motivation for our most important design choices ---> is t handig om alleen high level in te gaan op de implementatie? Lijkt me te karig}.

\subsubsection{Modular Design}
Dealing with huge amounts of data and displaying this data in a way that makes is easy to understand for users is a challenging task.
