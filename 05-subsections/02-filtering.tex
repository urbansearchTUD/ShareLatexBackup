\section{Filtering}
The next step in the process is filtering documents as explained in section \ref{sec:filtering_docs} and can be seen in figure \ref{fig:overview}. The implementation depends on the pyahocorasick library, which checks the page and tries to match strings within the page. We can supply this class with a list of cities, however, by default the application will retrieve a list of cities from the database.

The implementation seemed straightforward at first, however, it became apparent that the algorithm matched substrings. For example, if a text contains "Amsterdammers" than the Aho-Corasick algorithm would match
