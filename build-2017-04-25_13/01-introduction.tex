\section{Introduction}

Common belief is that agglomeration benefits are key to economic growth \cite{porter2000location}. 
However it may be that this econmic growth's primary cause is the increase in (inter)national network embeddedness. 
We would like to further investigate this.
Similar to research efforts in other domains such as financial trade (Preis et al., 2013) sales forecasting (wu \& Brynjolfsson, 2013) and public health (Thornton et al., 2016), the idea is to develop search queries that capture urban-urban interactions as they can be found on the web through the co-occurence of geographical names on websites e.g. "Zeeuws-Vlaanderen + Amsterdam " OR "Amsterdam + Zeeuws-Vlaanderen". \\
%why is economic growth interesting?
