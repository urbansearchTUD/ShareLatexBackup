\chapter*{Preface and Acknowledgements}
As part of the TU Delft Computer Science Bachelor Project, we present our final report on the development of the UrbanSearch project. The client during this project was the OTB group, which is part of the Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment. The OTB group ”seeks to make a visible contribution to society by addressing societal challenges in the field of the built environment”. This report describes the research and development of the project over the course of ten weeks.
