% evaluate the product, and see whether we have at least the minimum viable product
% using the requirements and design goals (possibly in a table)
% make sure to add lots and lots of figures, tables and benchmarks here
% also add SIG stuff and talk about SCRUM

\section{Evaluation of Requirements}
In section \ref{sec:reqs} we declared the requirements for our program. Table \ref{requirements_pass/fail} shows which of these requirements passed or failed and why. \\

The program works as intended so all must haves passed. \\
There are however two should haves which failed. Finding correct relations proved more time-consuming than expected therefor our algorithm only discerns the top level relations (e.g. trade) and not sub levels (e.g. food trade). Furthermore there are a lot of places with duplicate names, yet no complete lists of these duplicates are available. Therefor it is less easy implementable than first thought. \\
Since other, more important, tasks took longer to implement than intended we did not make implement functionality to use Delpher to characterise relationships. We did add functionality to visualise the data by using a map. \\
As expected the would likes did not pass. It is theoretically possible to show all connections of all places on the map at the same time. However, it would result in a completely filled in map because there is a line for each relation so one would not be able to get any useful information from this.

\section{Process}

\subsection{Collaboration Between the Team Members}
The collaboration between the team members went well. The team members worked in a room in the faculty of architecture from 9-5 each day. Three of the four team members knew each other already. The work was divided even over the team members. 

\subsection{Collaboration Between the Team Members and the TU Delft Coach}
Each week 9:30 on Monday the team members had a meeting with the TU Delft coach. In the beginning there were some communication issues between the team and the coach but as the process went on communication became better.

\subsection{Collaboration Between the Team Members and the Client}
The collaboration between the team members and the client was good as well. 
Weekly meetings helped the team members making the product as good as possible to the clients wishes.
