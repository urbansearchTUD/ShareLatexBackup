\section{Project Evaluation}

% evaluate the product, and see whether we have at least the minimum viable product
% using the requirements and design goals (possibly in a table)
% make sure to add lots and lots of figures, tables and benchmarks here
% also add SIG stuff and talk about SCRUM

\subsection{Fulfilment of requirements}
In section \ref{sec:reqs} we declared the requirements for our program. Table \ref{requirements_pass/fail} shows which of these requirements passed or failed.

\subsection{Process}

\subsubsection{Collaboration between the team members}
The collebaration between the team members went well. The team members worked in a room in the faculty of architecture from 9-5 each day. Three of the four team members knew each other already. The work was devided even over the team members. 

\subsubsection{Collaboration between the team members and the TU Delft Coach}
Each week 9:30 on monday the team members had a meeting with the TU Delft coach. In the beginning there were some communication issues between the team and the coach but as the process went on communication became better.

\subsubsection{Collaboration between the team members and the client}
The collaboration between the team members and the client was good as well. 
Weekly meetings helped the team members making the product as good as possible to the clients wishes.
