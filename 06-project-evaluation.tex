\section{Evaluation of Requirements}
In section \ref{sec:reqs} we declared the requirements for our program. Table \ref{requirements_pass/fail} shows which of these requirements passed or failed and why. Failed requirements are discussed in section \ref{sec:Discussion - Open Issues}. As can be seen most of the requirements passed, but there are also some that failed. Most of the failed requirements are acceptable, but the failed must have is planned to be fixed in the last week of coding. Since this is after the due date for this report this fix can not be included in the report.\\

2 Exporting relations          & Fail        & Due to many delays in other parts, exporting the data was not achievable within the time set for the product.                                                                                                                         \\

1 Hierarchical relations       & Fail        & Since extracting relations from text documents was more challenging than first thought, hierarchical relations were not included.                                                         \\
2 Machine learning retrainable & Pass        & It is possible to retrain the machine learning by feeding it a set of labeled documents.                                                                                                                                              \\
3 Add large datasets           & Pass        & It is possible to add large  datasets, however since it does cause an increase in time needed to run the algorithm, we did not use a large dataset for our demo version.                     \\
4 Duplicate city names         & Fail        & The algorithm does not take cities with duplicate names, or names fitting to multiple cities into account, due to time constraints.                                                         \\

1 Use Delpher                  & Fail        & It is not possible to use data from Delpher unless it is already downloaded and stored.                                                                                                                                               \\
2 Visualisation for comparing  & Pass        & The front-end includes visualisation for comparing cities and relationships to each other.                                                                                                                                            \\

1 Show all connections         & Fail        & Theoreticly it is possible to do this, but it would result in a map on which relationships can not be differentiated from each other due to the large amount the system was not build for. \\
2 Other than .nl data          & Fail        & The classifier is only trained on Dutch domains.

\section{Evaluation of Design goals}
In section \ref{sec:design-goals} we discussed the design goals for this project. We came up with seven design goals on which we will reflect.

\subsection{Credible}
\todo{after results}

\subsection{Understandable}
\todo{after results}

\subsection{Scalable}
For scalability the goal was to allow the project to be scalable so that websites from other domains than .nl can be used. Since we used Neo4J for storing relationships and Neo4J is highly scalable, storing the relationships for other domains than .nl should not be a problem. 

\subsection{Pluggable}


\subsection{Exportable}

\subsection{Fast development}

\section{Process}

\subsection{Collaboration Between the Team Members}
The collaboration between the team members went well. The team members worked in a room in the faculty of architecture from 9-5 each day. Three of the four team members knew each other already. The work was divided even over the team members. 

\subsection{Collaboration Between the Team Members and the TU Delft Coach}
Each week 9:30 on Monday the team members had a meeting with the TU Delft coach. In the beginning there were some communication issues between the team and the coach but as the process went on communication became better.

\subsection{Collaboration Between the Team Members and the Client}
The collaboration between the team members and the client was good as well. 
Weekly meetings helped the team members making the product as good as possible to the clients wishes.
