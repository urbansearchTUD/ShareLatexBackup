\subsection{Accessing the Web Interface}
To access the web interface, you either need to be at a TUDelft location, or use a virtual private network (vpn) connected to the TUDelft network. For information on how to use a vpn, please use the TUDelft website ("https://intranet.tudelft.nl/services/fmvgict-pdc/netwerk/draadloos-netwerk/virtual-private-network-vpn/"). When you have done this, you an use the url "http://citynetworks.bk.tudelft.nl/" to access the urbansearch program. When you enter this url you should have a menu to the left of the page, and a map on the right. After a few seconds of loading, the map on the right will display a couple of cities and relationships.
