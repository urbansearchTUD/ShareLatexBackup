\section{Related Work}
In this section we will discuss existing methods to extract relations and their strength between cities. Currently there are only two methods that are considered. The first is to manually process data from search engines. The second is to look at what cities companies are located in. After discussing these two methods we will also take a look at NLTK \cite{nlkt_stemming}. NLTK is  a text processing tool on which (a part of) our system will be based.\\

The first currently used method is to manually process data from search engines. Researchers will input a query in a search engine (for example Google). Then they will check how many websites are found. They will also take a tiny subset of those websites, and classify them manually. There are a few problems that arise with this method. The first one is that a lot of works needs to be done by hand, which takes a lot of man-hours, more then when it is done by a machine. The second is that humans are biased in what they belief is important, contrary to computers, which do not suffer from this flaw. \\

Another method that might be used is to look at companies and to look in which cities they are located. Although this might be a good indicator of the economic relations between cities, this completely ignores other relations cities might have with each other.\\

With our application we would like to process raw text from websites. Therefor we will take a look at NLTK. NLTK is a program which finds relations between texts. NLTK lacks the functionality to extract text data from websites and visually show the results however, so we would need to extend it.
