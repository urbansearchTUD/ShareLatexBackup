\todo{Although the fact that “cities are systems within systems of cities” (Berry, 1964) is now widely recognised by scholars and policy makers, there are still important gaps in the way those ‘systems of cities’, or more precisely interurban relationships, are measured. The first one is that the majority of works on urban systems uses proxies to approach interactions that often relate to ‘stock’ variables such as city-size, economic specialisation or location of public and private institutions. While this may give some insights in interurban relations, they do not capture the actual links between cities. The second gap is that those studies that do measure actual flows such as transportation studies are often too specific and do not take into account the diversity of relations, or in the words of Burger et al. (2014), the multiplexity of interurban relationships. A growing share of people daily activities now occurs online or are recorded through a multitude of digital traces which can be indicative of urban life. These digital traces are indicative of the social and economic networks which link cities among each other.}

==============================\\

In this section, we discuss several existing methods to measure relations and their strength between cities. Currently there are many different methods available to measure the strength of relations between cities, however these methods all have limitations. Below we will discuss the most common and why they do not not suit our problem.\\

One of the most common methods used is the interlocking network model (INM)\cite{taylor2012interlocking}. This model assumes cities have a flow of knowledge connection if there are offices of the same company in those cities. The biggest problem with this is that it is very limited. It only includes one relation type and it is disputable whether this is a good measurement for the relation. \\

When looking at digital data there are two different approaches: the cyberspace and the cyberplace \cite{devriendt2008cyberplace}. The cyberplace measures relations by using the infrastructure of the internet, for example internet hyperlinks, the structure of search engines and email traffic.\\
The cyberspace method focuses on the virtual communication of people through connected devices. One approach is by registering and mapping the number of pages indexed by search engines for queries containing the names of two cities. The problem is that large scale applications for this approach have been absent. The splitting of the relations between cities to different topics, for example, is missing. \\

Therefore we intend develop a computer program which does this. It will automatically find predefined relations between cities and their strength by using all pages available from search engines. In the following chapter we will investigate the requirements such a program should have.
