\section{Related Work}
In this section we will discuss the current methods to extract relations and their strength between cities. Currently there are only two methods that are considered. The first is to manually process data from search engines. The second is to look at in what cities companies are located. After discussing these two methods we will also take a loot at NLTK \cite{nlkt_stemming}. NLTK is  a text processing tool on which (a part of) our system will be based.\\

The first currently used method is to manually process data from search engines. Researchers will input a query in a search engine (for example Google). Then they will check how many websites are found. They will also take a tiny subset of those websites, and classify them manually. There are a few problems that arise with this method. The first one is that a lot of works needs to be done by hand, which takes a lot of man-hours more then when it is done by a machine. The second is that humans are biased on what they belief is important instead of when it is automatically generated. \\

Another method that might be used is to look at companies and look at in what cities they are located. Although this might be a good indicator of the economic relations between cities, this completely ignores other relations cities might have with each other.\\

With our method we would like to process the websites through an algorithm by using the raw text from this. NLTK is a program to find relations between texts. Therefor we might base our own application on it. We would need to extend it so that we can use data from websites and so that we can visually show the data. Also although NLTK can find relations between text there are some algorithms which NLTK does not use and we might consider.

In economics there is the question "What factors play a role in economic growth?". To answer this question you would first need to give a clear definition of economic growth itself. Economic growth can be seen as a positive change in the level of goods and services produced by a city over a certain period of time. An important characteristic is that economic growth is not the same in different sectors. Economic growth can be achieved when the rate of increase in total output is greater than the rate of increase in population of a city. \\

According to Harvard University three general theories of Economic Growth within cities \cite{glaeser1992growth} are those of Marshall-Arrow-Romer (MAR) theory (1986), Porter's theory (1990) and Jacobs theory (1969). These theories focus on knowledge spillovers and claim they are most effective in cities because communication between people is more extensive. The thoeries are based on in one company improves techniquely other companies near it will also benefit. These theories differ on whether monopolies or competition benifit the growth and whether the influence is within the same industry or not (e.g. brassiere and lingerie industry). \\
Other studies focus instead on the growth of countries instead of cities. Economist Alexander Cairncross wrote that the most important factors are investment, technical process, development and trade \cite{cairncross2013factors}. Economist Stanley Fischer focusses on the influence of macroeconomics (inflation, large budged deficits, distorted foreign echange markets) \cite{fischer1993role}. Economists Rudiger Dornbusch and Alejandro Reynoso claim the most important aspects differ per region \cite{dornbusch1989financial}. \\
In other words, there are many theories and there is much research on what plays an important factor in economic growth. Although MAR's Porter's and Jacob's theory do claim one of the reason for more economic growth in cities is due to more communication between people, much research into the connectivity between cities seem to be missing. One approach that has been taken is to look at where international companies are located. This only gives limited information however. Therefore we would like to see what information can be gathered from the internet by using search engines with input consisting of 2 cities.
