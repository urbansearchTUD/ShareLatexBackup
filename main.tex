\input{00-frontpage}
% Academic people like this, bit of 
\input{00-preface-and-acknowledgements}
% Instead of abstract, add a single page summary
\input{00-summary}
% Three parts: background, methodology and structure
\input{01-introduction}
% ~10 references at least, pick from Antoine's work
\input{02-related-work}
% subsections:
% 3.1 problem definition
% 3.2 problem analysis
% 3.3 requirement analysis (with design goals, requirements and minimal viable product)
\input{03-problem-definition-and-analysis}
% same as research report, but add section "evaluation strategies"
\input{04-framework-and-tools}
% Describe how we used the selected tools to actually build the framework
% Also describe the modules we designed, including code snippets and UML stuff
% Make sure to split back-end and front-end here, but discuss how they are linked
\input{05-framework-implementation}
% evaluate the product, and see whether we have at least the minimum viable product
% using the requirements and design goals (possibly in a table)
% make sure to add lots and lots of figures, tables and benchmarks here
% also add SIG stuff and talk about SCRUM
\input{06-project-evaluation}
% describe issues faced during implementation, as well as issues that are still 
% open. Main thing here is to discuss the Neo4j python driver with multiprocessing,
% which we could not get to work. Also mention the state of the document 
% classification
% DONT FORGET a subsection on ethical issues!
\input{07-discussion}
% Make recommendations for future version, for extending the back-end and front-end
% Try to mention the requirements here
\input{08-recommendations}
% Start with "In the past few months we blah" and shortly mention the chapters
% Mention the project goal and how well it is met, without duplicating the 
% evaluation chapter
\input{09-conclusion}
