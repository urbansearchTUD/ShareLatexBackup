\chapter{Framework and Tools}\label{sec:framework-and-tools}
\todo{split in 04 and 05 and include code quality and validation}

In this section, we gradually develop the framework. First, we give a high-level overview of the system. Second, we decide what data source to use initially and describe how to use the data. Third, we present the method of choice to perform initial data filtering. Fourth, we agree on which data storage and ingestion to use. Fifth, we provide a methodology to group the data. Sixth, we decide how users will interact with the obtained results. Last, we select the visualisation tools to be used. \todo{Alle stukken aankondigen}
%In this section, we evaluate what data sources are useful. Additionally, we discuss several methods and tools that can be helpful in storing and ingesting data. Furthermore, we describe numerous methods to filter and classify textual data. Then, we elaborate on different methods to perform queries with. We conclude with an overview of the available visualisation tools that can be used for displaying the results of the analysis.
