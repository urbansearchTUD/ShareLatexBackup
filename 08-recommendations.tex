\chapter{Recommendations}
For future improvements on this project one might decide upon two ways to do this. The first is to look at the requirements which have not yet been fulfilled and fulfil those. Depending on the needs of the user one might want to implement different things. For extending the application to international places one would want to use data from top-level domains other than .nl. However others might be interested in finding different relations, for which one would need to have other training data.
If one has more time it might be interesting to instead of using a classification algorithm, to choose a clustering algorithm. \todo{extend}
