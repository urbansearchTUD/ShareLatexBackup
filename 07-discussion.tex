% See http://libguides.usc.edu/writingguide/discussion for how to write a discussion

This section is divided into three parts. First we will discuss the influence of the research questions. Next we will mention issues we faced and which still remain. The last part of this section is dedicated to the ethical questions this project may involve.

\section{Discussing the research question answers something} \todo{better title}

\section{Issues Faced During Development}
\todo{memory problems}
    
\todo{multiprocessing}
\todo{text encoding}
\todo{python neo4j driver}


\section{Open Issues}\label{sec:Discussion - Open Issues}
\todo{Discuss choice to filter "Amsterdammers", future version might include this}
\todo{exporting data}
\todo{uneven amount of documents/class}
\todo{language}
\todo{processing time}
\todo{neo4j problems}
\todo{more....}

% describe issues faced during implementation, as well as issues that are still 
% open. Main thing here is to discuss the Neo4j python driver with multiprocessing,
% which we could not get to work. Also mention the state of the document

\section{Ethics}
In this section some of the ethical issues with respect to the developed product are discussed. 

\subsection{Storage}
%One ethical issue is due to the storing of data. Since we store random web pages we do not know whether or not these pages may contain private or copyrighted data. For instance news articles could be downloaded and stored whilst this could violate the copyright issues. For most free news sites this is not a problem but this especially becomes a problem when using Delpher as a data source. Therefor if this source is added it must also be ensured that the data is stored in a safe way.

\subsection{Impact of Found Relations}
%Another issue that may occur is the influence this kind of research may have. If there is indeed a correlation between the results of our program and the economic growth of cities this may influence the behaviour of investors, companies and cities. Investors may look at the data and decide to invest in companies from more growing cities. Companies may use this data to decide where to build their new offices. And cities may change their policies based on the results. In future executions of our system it may also occur that data is being manipulated. Involved parties which put extra data online containing the names of cities they want to have a better result for. Whilst these issues may occur, we do not suspect our system to have a large enough impact to cause this. It may rather be a step towards these effects. Over time the effects will become clearer and they should be taken into account when continuing research in this field.
