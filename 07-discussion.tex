% See http://libguides.usc.edu/writingguide/discussion for how to write a discussion

This section is divided into 4 parts. First we will answer the research question and comment on the sub-problems defined in the problem definition. Afterwards we will discuss the influence of these answers. Next we will mention issues we faced and which still remain. The last part of this section is dedicated to the ethical questions this project may involve.


\section{Answering the research question}


As mentioned in section \ref{sec:problem-definition-analysis}, the main problem was the following:
\begin{quote} 
\centering 
\textit{How can open data be leveraged such that a metric for the strength of relationships between cities can be defined and visualised?}
\end{quote}

To answer this question we came up with several sub-problems. These sub-problems, together with their answer and the reason for their importance are the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item How can we filter the available text data to find co-occurrences of cities and discarding text data that does not contain co-occurrences? \\
    
    As shown in section \ref{sec:5-filtering} the python package pyahocorasick can be used to check the text data and try to match words within the text data. However, the algorithm also checks words that are part of compound words. Therefor, in case that is not wanted, the package will have to be extended to add this extra control. \\
    
    This should reduce the amount of data and thereby potentially speed up the rest of process.
    
    \item The sub-problem that arises after filtering is how to determine what relationships can be extracted from the text-data, this will be referred to as the classification of the text-data. \\
    
    In section \ref{5-classification} ... \todo{}
    
    This requires a method that reliably and efficiently processes the text-data and can be tuned to the clients wishes, meaning that the classification should output what the client desires. 
    
    \item The next question is how to store the data and determine the strength of the relationships. \\
    
    Section \ref{sec: 5-storing} shows that we need storage for the text documents, as well as for extracted relations. The text documents can simply be stored on the disk. For the extracted relations the graph database Neo4j can be used. \\
    For determining the strength of relationships the classifier is used. We simply count the numbers of documents that have been found for each relation and use those numbers as the strength of the relationships.
    
    
    \item The last question is how to combine the stored data and present it to a user, this means visualising and/or exporting the data in an accessible way.\\
    
    As for visualising the data, section \ref{sec: 5-frontend} shows 
    \\

\section{Ethics}
When using our program, there are two ethical issues that may arrive. The first is due to the fact that pages may be downloaded and stored, which may result in privacy or copyright issues. The second is about what the results of our program may be used for, and how the world will react to this.

\subsubsection{Storage}
One ethical issue is due to the storing of data. Since we store random web pages we do not know whether or not these pages may contain private or copyrighted data. For instance news articles could be downloaded and stored whilst this could violate the copyright issues. For most free news sites this is not a problem but this especially becomes a problem when using Delpher as a data source. Therefor if this source is added it must also be ensured that the data is stored in a safe way.

\subsubsection{Influence}
Another issue that may occur is the influence this kind of research may have. If there is indeed a correlation between the results of our program and the economic growth of cities this may influence the behaviour of investors, companies and cities. Investors may look at the data and decide to invest in companies from more growing cities. Companies may use this data to decide where to build their new offices. And cities may change their policies based on the results. In future executions of our system it may also occur that data is being manipulated. Involved parties which put extra data online containing the names of cities they want to have a better result for. Whilst these issues may occur, we do not suspect our system to have a large enough impact to cause this. It may rather be a step towards these effects. Over time the effects will become clearer and they should be taken into account when continuing research in this field.
